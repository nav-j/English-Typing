## 1. Learn proper finger placement (very important)

Use the **home row position**:

* Left hand: **A S D F**
* Right hand: **J K L ;**
* Thumbs: **Spacebar**
* Index fingers rest on **F** and **J** (they have small bumps)

**Tip:** Don’t look at the keyboard while typing.

## 2. Start slow, then build speed

Don’t try to type fast at first.
Focus on **accuracy first** → speed will automatically increase.

Start goal:

* Week 1: 20–25 WPM
* Week 2: 30–35 WPM
* Week 3: 40+ WPM

## 3. Use FREE practice websites

Practice daily for **15–20 minutes** on:

* typing.com
* keybr.com
* 10fastfingers.com
* monkeytype.com

(These help your muscle memory)

## 4. Practice this line daily

Type this 5–10 times (without looking):

> *The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.*

Then try numbers + symbols:

> *12345 !@#$% asdf jkl;*

## 5. Keep your posture correct

* Sit straight
* Screen at eye level
* Wrists relaxed (not on the table edge)

## 6. Track your progress

Test once every week:

* Aim to improve **+5 WPM per week**
